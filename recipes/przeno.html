    <h3>Easy to cook, hard to perfect</h3>
        <p>This is a summer staple where I live, and I don't want to spend 1 summer without it.</p>
        <p>Pros: very, veeery easy to make</p>
        <p>Cons: very, veeery addictive. Also sadness when theres no fresh veggies to make it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peppers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Spices</strong></li>

        </ul>
    <h3>What you need to do:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cutting: prepare you dish with slicing both the peppers and tomatoes in smallish chunks</li>
            <li>Add a bit of olive oil in a pan/wok and wait for it to get hot</li>
            <li>Add just the peppers for now,salt and pepper them then wait for them to get softer and get a bit of golden colour</li>
            <li>When the peppers have been there for about 6-7-8 minutes you can add the tomatoes</li>
            <li>Once the tomatoes are in you can close the lid (or don't) and then be patient, it can take 15 minutes</li>
            <li>When you can no longer see a tomato slice, and theres just pepper and tomato sauce in the pan - turn the stove to low heat</li>
            <li>Last but not least: Add 2-3 eggs to the pan and whisk everything together furiously until theres no raw egg </li>
            <li>Done. Enjoy :)</li>
        </ol>
