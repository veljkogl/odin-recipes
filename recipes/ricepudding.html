    <h3>The perfect dessert</h3>
        <p>This is one of my favorite sweet delights for any season, but the colder it is outside the better.</p>
        <p>It is a relatively international dish, but the version I make is originally Serbian-Turkish "Sutlijas".</p>
        <p>Very easy to make, you just need a bit of elbow grase ;).</p>
    <h3>Key components:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> long-grain or whichever one you got</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong>this one is optional </li>
            <li><strong>Coconut flour</strong></li>
        </ul>    
    <h3>Steps towards deliciousness:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take 1 cup of rice and wash it (3-4 times) with cold water</li>
            <li>Put the rice in a pot and add a 1 and a half cup water</li>
            <li>Cook the rice until the water has almost entirely dissipated</li>
            <li>Add 1 and a half cups of milk</li>
            <li>Once you add the milk, make sure you watch over the pot and keep stirring the rice (this is where the elbow grease comes into play)</li>
            <li>Add 3 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of coconut flour, and a bit of Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Keep stirring - the rice is done when it is not hard but also not falling appart</li>
            <li>Add whatever you think the recipe needs :)</li>
        </ol>
