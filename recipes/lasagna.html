    <h3> How I got this recipe </h3>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
        but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
